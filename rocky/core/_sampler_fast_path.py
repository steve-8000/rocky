"""Fused top-p + temperature sampler for the common chat sampler config.

mlx-lm's ``make_sampler`` builds a closure chain of independent
``@mx.compile``'d functions::

    sampler(logprobs) ->
        apply_top_p(logprobs, top_p)         # @mx.compile #1
        categorical_sampling(masked, temp)   # @mx.compile #2

For the dominant chat config ``(temp > 0, 0 < top_p < 1, no min_p, no
xtc, no logits_processors)`` (with optional ``top_k > 0`` layered on top
of the active nucleus cut) this costs ~4.3 ms / token on Qwen 3.6 35B
4-bit @ B=1 on M3 Ultra, split as:

* ~0.9 ms Python — three closure dispatches per step (mlx-lm chain runs
  ``apply_top_p`` closure, then ``categorical_sampling`` closure, both
  inside the per-row dispatch loop inside ``GenerationBatch._step``).
* ~3.3 ms GPU — the two ``@mx.compile`` boundaries break lazy-graph
  fusion across ``apply_top_p`` -> ``categorical_sampling``, forcing a
  separate kernel-launch sync; ``apply_top_p`` also builds a vocab-sized
  ``inverse_indices`` array (``mx.put_along_axis`` + ``mx.arange``) to
  undo the sort permutation back to vocab order so categorical can
  sample in vocab space — that scatter is the largest single op in the
  sampler chain.

mlx-vlm avoids both by sampling in sorted space inside one Python
function (``mlx_vlm/sample_utils.py:top_p_sampling``). The math is
identical for ``temperature=1``; mlx-vlm's variant applies the top-p
cutoff after temperature scaling, slightly changing the kept set when
``T != 1`` (sharper at ``T < 1``, wider at ``T > 1``).

This module ships a vendored single-function variant that **preserves
mlx-lm semantics exactly**: the top-p cutoff is computed on
``exp(logprobs)`` (the unscaled probability distribution, matching
``apply_top_p``); temperature is applied to the masked logits before
``mx.random.categorical``. Only the index space differs (sorted vs
vocab order) — the kept set, the relative weights inside it, and the
expected sample distribution are all identical to mlx-lm's chain.

The two observable differences vs mlx-lm are both bit-level (not
distributional):

1. Sample determinism under a fixed ``mx.random.seed``: mlx-lm draws
   Gumbel noise in vocab order while we draw it in sorted order, so
   two engines with the same seed pick different tokens. The
   distributions match; the bit-level sequence does not. Not a
   regression for OpenAI-style ``seed=`` requests which only promise
   within-engine reproducibility.

2. Tie-break at the ``top_k`` cutoff: mlx-lm's ``apply_top_k`` uses
   ``mx.argpartition`` (unstable on ties), the fast path uses
   ``mx.argsort`` + position-based mask (stable but ordering depends on
   the sort implementation). When two logits are bit-exact tied at the
   ``top_k`` cutoff, the two paths may keep different specific tokens
   from the tied pair — but BOTH paths keep exactly ``top_k`` tokens
   and the dropped one has the same logit value as the kept one. The
   sampled token-frequency distribution is therefore mathematically
   identical (tied tokens are fungible by definition); only the
   specific token ID differs. In practice production fp32 logits from
   real models never tie exactly (probability ~2⁻²³ per pair), so this
   corner case only matters for synthetic test inputs. Pinned with
   ``test_top_k_tie_at_boundary_keeps_k_tokens``.

    Math is identical to mlx-lm's ``apply_top_p`` (on unscaled probs) ->
    ``apply_top_k`` -> ``categorical_sampling`` (with ``logits * 1/T``).
    Index space differs: we sample in sorted space and map back via one
    ``take_along_axis`` instead of building ``inverse_indices`` to undo
    the sort permutation. top-k drops out for free because the sort is
    already done; we just intersect a position mask in sorted space.

    Args:
        temperature: Sampling temperature. Must be > 0.
        top_p: Nucleus cutoff. Must be in ``(0, 1)`` — the fast path
            requires an active nucleus cut. ``top_p == 1`` short-circuits
            in mlx-lm (no mask to apply); ``top_p == 0`` is degenerate.
        top_k: Top-k cutoff. ``top_k > 0`` enables the additional mask
            layered on top of top-p; ``top_k == 0`` (default) leaves
            only top-p active.

    Active top-p is required — top-k-only configurations should route

    isn't also active. See ``is_fused_top_p_eligible``.

    Returns:
        A callable ``sampler(logprobs) -> token_ids`` matching the
        shape contract mlx-lm uses inside ``GenerationBatch._step``:
