"""Auto-pull confirmation gate for large model downloads.

Persona-3 ("Ollama switcher") feedback (2026-05): running

    rocky chat qwen3-coder-4bit

against an alias that wasn't yet cached silently kicked off a 41.8 GB
download with no ``[Y/n]`` prompt. The download itself ran fine, but
because the spawned ``serve`` subprocess captured stdout to a logfile,
the user saw a blank screen and assumed the CLI was hung.

This module is the user-visible safety net. It is intentionally
self-contained (no rocky imports) so it stays cheap to import from
``cli.main()`` on every invocation.

Public API:

* :func:`estimate_repo_size_bytes` — best-effort HF API size lookup.
* :func:`confirm_or_abort`         — prompt + abort path used by the CLI.
* :func:`is_repo_cached`           — cache-presence probe (so callers can
  short-circuit without re-implementing the path dance).

Design choices:

* The HF call is wrapped in a hard 5-second timeout and a blanket
  ``except Exception`` — a flaky metadata query must never block a
  perfectly-good cached load, and we already gate on cache presence
  upstream of the size estimate.
* The threshold defaults to 10 GiB. Anything under that is too small
  to warrant interrupting the user's flow.
* The env override (``RAPID_MLX_AUTO_PULL=1``) is the documented escape
  hatch for non-interactive CI usage and ``--yes``-style workflows.
* Non-TTY stdin → auto-confirm. Scripts that pipe input into
  ``rocky`` must not deadlock on a missing terminal.
