Reasoning parser for the GLM-4 family (GLM-4.5-Air, GLM-4.6V, GLM-4.7).

GLM-4 uses ``<think>...</think>`` tags for reasoning content. Unlike
Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1, GLM-4's chat template does NOT inject ``<think>``
in the prompt — the model decides autonomously whether to reason. So:

- Output with both tags: reasoning + content (standard case).
- Output with no tags at all: pure content, NOT implicit reasoning.
  The base class' "no tags yet → treat as reasoning" default is correct
  for Qwen3 (where ``<think>`` is injected in the prompt and missing
  tags mean truncated reasoning) but wrong for GLM-4. This parser
  overrides that one branch.

GLM-4.6V additionally wraps content in
``<|begin_of_box|>...<|end_of_box|>`` container markers; we strip them
so the user-facing content stays clean.

Adapted from upstream waybarrios/rocky#295 (``Glm4ReasoningParser``).
Upstream uses a ``_phase`` enum state machine; our base class uses a
``_saw_any_tag`` flag (see ``think_parser.py``). The behavioural
divergence is the same — only the override surface differs.
