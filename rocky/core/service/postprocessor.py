          - Capped (parallel=false): for each delta, if its ``index``
            is already admitted, pass through (continuation). If
            ``index`` is absent AND the delta carries ONLY argument
            fragments (no new ``id`` / ``name``), treat it as a

            full call past the cap.
          - Cap-full new calls are dropped, AND their later
