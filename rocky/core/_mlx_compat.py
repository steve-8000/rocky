MLX hardware-compatibility shims.

Currently handles one upstream issue:

**M5 single-stream GPU (#404)**: `mlx_lm/generate.py` does

    generation_stream = mx.new_thread_local_stream(mx.default_device())

at module-import time. On M1–M4, this returns a usable thread-local stream.
On M5, the call appears to succeed (returning a Stream handle), but later
``with mx.stream(generation_stream):`` raises

    RuntimeError: There is no Stream(gpu, 1) in current thread.

because the M5 GPU only exposes a single stream slot. Every pure-attention
model crashes at first prompt evaluation. Hybrid models (Qwen3.5/3.6) work
because their custom path doesn't import ``mlx_lm.generate``.

Fix: monkey-patch ``mx.new_thread_local_stream`` with a probe-and-cache
wrapper. On the first call we attempt a trivial op inside ``mx.stream(s)``;
if it raises, we cache that fact and return ``mx.default_stream(device)``
for all subsequent calls. Single-stream devices then run with the default
stream, losing parallel-issue throughput but staying functional. Hardware
that supports multiple streams gets the original behavior — the probe is
one-time per device.

This patch must execute *before* any ``import mlx_lm.generate``, since
that module captures the returned stream at module level. The install
hook is called at the top of every consumer that imports
``mlx_lm.generate`` (currently ``rocky/scheduler.py`` and
``rocky/pipeline/decode.py``) — *not* from ``rocky/__init__.py``.
We deliberately keep ``import rocky`` free of any ``mlx.core`` import
so the package stays usable for metadata-only access on systems where
``mlx`` is installed but Metal is unavailable (``import mlx.core``
SIGABRTs there with an uncatchable NSException).

Upstream tracking: file mlx-lm bug + remove this shim when upstream lands
a device-capability check.
