"""SuffixDecoding — adaptive suffix-tree speculative drafter.

Draft-model-free speculative decoding for token-level inference. Builds a
sliding index over the prompt + generated tokens, and at each generation
step proposes a variable-length draft sequence by looking at *all* prior
occurrences of the current suffix and ranking continuations by frequency.

Compared to plain Prompt Lookup Decoding (PLD)
(``rocky/speculative/prompt_lookup.py``), this drafter:

  1. Considers **all** match positions, not just the first, so an
     occasional spurious match can't drag the draft off the most likely
     continuation.
  2. **Adaptively truncates** the draft at the first low-confidence
     position. PLD always emits ``num_draft_tokens`` regardless of
     confidence, which wastes verify cycles when the suffix tree is
     ambiguous.
  3. Tracks **per-position acceptance** so the verify loop can be greedy
     about long matches when the index is confident, and conservative
     when it's not.

Reference: SuffixDecoding (NeurIPS 2025) https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04975
— same algorithmic idea, simpler data structure (we use a dict-based
suffix index, not a trie/automaton, because the PoC's history sizes
fit comfortably in O(N²) suffix construction time).

The ``Drafter`` class is engine-agnostic and only needs (a) a token
stream to index and (b) a way to query for a draft. Wiring it into
BatchedEngine's verify loop is the responsibility of the caller —
see ``scripts/bench_suffix_decoding.py`` for a single-request reference
integration via ``mlx_lm`` directly.

    """Adaptive suffix-index drafter.

    Maintains an index from each k-gram (k in [1, max_suffix_len]) to the
    list of positions where it ends. Querying with the current history's
    last k tokens returns earlier positions; the drafter then picks the
    next ``max_draft_tokens`` continuation by majority vote across all
    matches, truncating where confidence drops.

    Args:
        max_draft_tokens: Cap on draft length per call. The verify forward
            cost grows linearly with this; pick based on your model's
            attention cost vs. expected acceptance. Typical values 4-16.
        max_suffix_len: Longest suffix prefix to index (k-gram size). Longer
            suffixes are more discriminating but slower to build. 4 is a
            good default — covers most repeated-phrase cases without
            blowing up index size.
        min_confidence: Minimum fraction of matches that must agree on the
            next token. Below this, drafting truncates. Lower → more
            optimistic drafts (more verify-then-reject); higher → fewer
            but more reliable drafts. 0.3 from the SuffixDecoding paper.
        max_history: Hard cap on indexed history. Old tokens are dropped
            from the index when this is exceeded — keeps memory bounded
            on long generations. Set to None to disable.
