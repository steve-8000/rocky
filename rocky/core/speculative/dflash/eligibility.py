"""DFlash eligibility checks — gate the feature behind validated combos.

This is the single chokepoint between user intent (``--enable-dflash`` on
the CLI) and the runtime hook. Failures here surface as actionable error
messages at server-start, never as silent regressions at request time.

Gates derived from PoC bench data (see issue #264):
  - Alias must declare ``supports_dflash=True`` (explicit opt-in)
  - Alias must NOT be ``is_moe=True`` (MoE acceptance floors at ~1.5)
  - Main model must be 8-bit or higher; detected from the HF path
    naming convention (``-4bit``/``mxfp4``/``nvfp4`` suffixes used by
    mlx-community). A custom-named 4-bit repo would slip through this
    heuristic — for v1 we accept that risk since every supported alias
    is curated; load-time quant-config inspection is a phase-2 item.
  - Drafter HF path must be reachable (no auth-gated repo without token)
