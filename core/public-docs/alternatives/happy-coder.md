# Rocky vs Happy Coder

Happy Coder is a mobile and web client for Claude Code and Codex. It wraps the agent CLI on your laptop and syncs sessions to phone and browser over an end-to-end encrypted relay. Open source under MIT.

Rocky is an app for orchestrating coding agents, with native clients on desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source (AGPL-3.0).

## When to pick what

Pick Happy Coder if you want the most minimal setup. Wrap an existing Claude Code or Codex session on your laptop and check in on it from your phone.

Pick Rocky if you want:

- A native desktop app on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Git worktrees for parallel agents
- Per-worktree dev server URLs
- GitHub PRs, checks, reviews, and merges in the app
- Many more agents than Claude Code and Codex
- A CLI to script agent work and drive remote daemons

## Architecture

Rocky runs the agent inside its own daemon. The daemon owns the agent lifecycle, the worktree, and the dev servers. Clients connect over a websocket and drive the daemon.

Happy Coder runs the agent inside its existing CLI on your laptop and syncs the session to its mobile and web clients through an end-to-end encrypted relay.

## Panes

Rocky's app has split panes and tabs (⌘D for vertical, ⌘⇧D for horizontal). Panes include a terminal alongside your agents, a diff viewer, and a browser for testing running services.

Happy Coder does not have a desktop app.

## GitHub

Rocky's app handles commit, push, opening PRs, watching checks and reviews, and merging.

## Mobile

Both tools ship native iOS and Android apps.

## Providers

Rocky runs Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi natively, plus 30+ more agents through the in-app catalog including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Amp. Rocky speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so any ACP agent works. Custom providers run any CLI agent. See [Supported providers](/docs/supported-providers).

Happy Coder runs Claude Code and Codex.

## Worktrees and services

Rocky runs each agent in its own git worktree. Each worktree gets its own dev server URL like `web.fix-auth.my-app.localhost`, so parallel agents don't fight for the same port.

Happy Coder runs the agent in the directory you launched the CLI from.

## CLI

Rocky has a CLI that mirrors the app:

```bash
rocky run --provider codex "implement OAuth"
rocky run --host devbox:6767 "run the test suite"
rocky ls
rocky send <agent-id> "add tests"
rocky schedule create --cron "0 9 * * 1" "audit the codebase"
```

`rocky run --host` connects to a remote daemon. `rocky schedule` runs an agent on a cron. `rocky loop` retries an agent until a verification command passes.

Happy Coder has a CLI to launch the wrapped session. It does not have schedules or loops.

## Voice

Rocky's speech-to-text and text-to-speech run locally on your device. Nothing leaves your network.
