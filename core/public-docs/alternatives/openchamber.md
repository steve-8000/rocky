# Rocky vs OpenChamber

OpenChamber is a macOS desktop app for OpenCode. Also available as a PWA. Open source under MIT.

Rocky is an app for orchestrating coding agents, with native clients on desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source (AGPL-3.0).

## Why pick Rocky

OpenChamber runs on macOS, around OpenCode, with a phone PWA. Rocky runs OpenCode too, on macOS, and adds:

- Linux and Windows desktop
- A native iOS and Android app
- Many more agents than OpenCode (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, plus 30+ more via the in-app ACP catalog)
- A scriptable CLI to drive agents and connect to remote daemons

## Mobile

Rocky ships a native iOS and Android app with the same feature set as the desktop. Install from the App Store or Google Play.

OpenChamber does not have a native mobile app.

## Desktop

Rocky ships on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

OpenChamber ships on macOS.

## Providers

Rocky runs Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi natively, plus 30+ more agents through the in-app catalog including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Amp. Rocky speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so any ACP agent works. Custom providers run any CLI agent. See [Supported providers](/docs/supported-providers).

OpenChamber is built around OpenCode.

## Panes

Rocky's app has split panes and tabs (⌘D for vertical, ⌘⇧D for horizontal). Panes include a terminal alongside your agents, a diff viewer, and a browser for testing running services.

## GitHub

Rocky's app handles commit, push, opening PRs, watching checks and reviews, and merging.

## CLI

Rocky has a CLI that mirrors the app:

```bash
rocky run --provider codex "implement OAuth"
rocky run --host devbox:6767 "run the test suite"
rocky ls
rocky send <agent-id> "add tests"
rocky schedule create --cron "0 9 * * 1" "audit the codebase"
```

`rocky run --host` connects to a remote daemon. `rocky schedule` runs an agent on a cron. `rocky loop` retries an agent until a verification command passes.

OpenChamber does not have a CLI.

## Worktrees and services

Rocky runs each agent in its own git worktree. Each worktree gets its own dev server URL like `web.fix-auth.my-app.localhost`, so parallel agents don't fight for ports.

## Voice

Rocky's speech-to-text and text-to-speech run locally on your device. OpenChamber does not have voice.
